        <title>What’s in a sentence?</title>
        <para>Take this sentence:</para>
        <blockquote>
            <para><quote>I give you this.</quote></para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>
            What make up this sentence?
            The core of it is <quote>give</quote>.
            That is the relation describing how the other things are involved
            with each other, how they connect and relate.
            Those involved things are <quote>I</quote>,
            <quote>you</quote> and <quote>this</quote>.
            These could be said to be variable
            — they are not fixed with the relation <quote>give</quote>.
            Rather than giving you <quote>this</quote>
            I could give you <quote>that</quote> instead.
            Or maybe it is you who give me something,
            and we would still be describing a relationship of giving.
            We could say that the relation <quote>give</quote>
            has three variable places that we can fill with different things.
            Thus we can define <quote>give</quote> as such:
        </para>
        <blockquote><para>Someone gives someone something.</para></blockquote>
        <para>
            We could label the variable places more clearly,
            numbering them and using <quote>x</quote> which is commonly used
            to describe something unknown or unspecified:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                x<subscript>1 [donor]</subscript> gives
                x<subscript>2 [receiver]</subscript>
                x<subscript>3 [gift]</subscript>
            </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>or more simply:</para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                x<subscript>1</subscript> gives
                x<subscript>2</subscript>
                x<subscript>3</subscript>
            </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>
            This says that we have a variable
            (<quote>x</quote>) place 1 that is a donor,
            a place 2 that is a receiver and a place 3 that is a gift.
            They share the relation <quote>give</quote>.
        </para>
        <para>
            The Lojban word for <quote>give</quote>
            is <glossterm>dunda</glossterm>.
            It has this definition:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                x<subscript>1</subscript> [donor] gives/donates gift/present
                x<subscript>2</subscript> to recipient/beneficiary
                x<subscript>3</subscript> [without payment/exchange]
            </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>We can simplify this:</para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                x<subscript>1</subscript> gives
                x<subscript>2</subscript> to
                x<subscript>3</subscript>
            </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>
            You might notice that the gift and receiver switched places here,
            which we represented in English
            by adding the preposition <quote>to</quote>.
        </para>
        <para>
            We call definitions like these <quote>place structures</quote>,
            because they show the structure of the variable places we can fill.
            In Lojban, we call the relation a <glossterm>selbri</glossterm>
            and the variables <glossterm>sumti</glossterm>.
            We call the whole sentence a <glossterm>bridi</glossterm>.
            Linguists and logicians call the sentences
            <quote>predicate relationships</quote>,
            the variables <quote>arguments</quote>
            and the relations <quote>predicates</quote>
            or <quote>predicate relations</quote>.
