        <title>What’s in a sentence?</title>
        <para>Take this sentence:</para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>“I give you this.”</para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>
            What make up this sentence?
            The core of it is “give”.
            That is the relation describing how the other things are involved
            with each other, how they connect and relate.
            Those involved things are “I”, “you” and “this”.
            These could be said to be variable
            — they are not fixed with the relation “give”.
            Rather than giving you “this” I could give you “that” instead.
            Or maybe it is you who give me something,
            and we would still be describing a relationship of giving.
            We could say that the relation “give” has three variable places
            that we can fill with different things.
            Thus we can define “give” as such:
        </para>
        <blockquote><para>Someone gives someone something.</para></blockquote>
        <para>
            We could label the variable places more clearly,
            numbering them and using “x” which is commonly used
            to describe something unknown or unspecified:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                x<subscript>1 [donor]</subscript> gives
                x<subscript>2 [receiver]</subscript>
                x<subscript>3 [gift]</subscript>
            </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>or more simply:</para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                x<subscript>1</subscript> gives
                x<subscript>2</subscript>
                x<subscript>3</subscript>
            </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>
            This says that we have a variable (“x”) place 1 that is a donor,
            a place 2 that is a receiver and a place 3 that is a gift.
            They share the relation “give”.
        </para>
        <para>
            The Lojban word for “give” is <glossterm>dunda</glossterm>.
            It has this definition:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                x<subscript>1</subscript> [donor] gives/donates gift/present
                x<subscript>2</subscript> to recipient/beneficiary
                x<subscript>3</subscript> [without payment/exchange]
            </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>We can simplify this:</para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                x<subscript>1</subscript> gives
                x<subscript>2</subscript> to
                x<subscript>3</subscript>
            </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>
            You might notice that the gift and receiver switched places here,
            which we represented in English by adding the preposition “to”.
        </para>
        <para>
            We call definitions like these “place structures”,
            because they show the structure of the variable places we can fill.
            In Lojban, we call the relation a <glossterm>selbri</glossterm>
            and the variables <glossterm>sumti</glossterm>.
            We call the whole sentence a <glossterm>bridi</glossterm>.
            Linguists and logicians call the sentences
            “predicate relationships”, the variables “arguments”
            and the relations “predicates” or “predicate relations”.
