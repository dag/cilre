        <h1>Place structure</h1>
        <h2>What’s in a sentence?</h2>
        <p>Take this sentence:</p>
        <blockquote>“I give you this.”</blockquote>
        <p>What make up this sentence?
        The core of it is “give”.
        That is the relationship describing how the other things are involved.
        Those involved things are “I”, “you” and “this”.
        These could be said to be variable.
        We could say that the relationship “give” has three variable places.
        Thus we can define “give” as such:</p>
        <blockquote>
          x<sub>1 [donor]</sub> gives
          x<sub>2 [receiver]</sub>
          x<sub>3 [gift]</sub>
        </blockquote>
        <p>or more simply:</p>
        <blockquote>x1 gives x2 x3</blockquote>
        <p>This says that we have a variable (“x”) place 1 that is a donor,
        a place 2 that is a receiver and a place 3 that is a gift.
        They share the relationship “give”.</p>
        <p>The Lojban word for “give” is <dfn>dunda</dfn>.
        It has this definition:</p>
        <blockquote>
          x1 [donor] gives/donates gift/present x2
          to recipient/beneficiary x3 [without payment/exchange]
        </blockquote>
        <p>We can simplify this:</p>
        <blockquote>x1 gives x2 to x3</blockquote>
        <p>You might notice that the gift and receiver switched places here,
        which we represented in English by adding the pronoun “to”.</p>
        <p>We call definitions like these “place structures”,
        because they show the structure of the variable places we can fill.
        In Lojban, we call the relationship a <dfn>selbri</dfn>
        and the variables <dfn>sumti</dfn>.
        We call the whole sentence a <dfn>bridi</dfn>.
        Linguists and logicians call the sentences “predicate relations”,
        the variables “arguments” and the relationships “predicates”
        or “predicate relationships”.</p>
